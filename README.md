<u>/<h1>ABOUT ME!</h1></u>

<p>I really like <em>coding</em> languages like HTML and Python!</p>

<p>I live in the UK and I am 11 years old!</p>

<p>I have been fascinated by languages since I was young, However I didn't know how to <em>write</em> with them.<p/>

<p>Until I came across Claude the AI, it helped me make this text as you are reading this, Thank you!!!<p/>

<u><h2>What do I want to do?</h2></u>

<p>Well I <em>want</em> to <strong>study</strong> to get good marks for the AP2.<br>
HTML is one of the easiest coding languages for absolute beginners<br> like me for example, its easy to learn,non-complex, easy to read and efficient.<br> Think of a house, <strong><em>HTML</em></strong> is the structure and <strong><em>CSS</em></strong> is the paint and <strong><em>JavaScript</em></strong> adds interactivity, which I want to learn!</p>
