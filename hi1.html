<u><h2>What do I want to do?</h2></u>

<p>Well I <em>want</em> to <strong>study</strong> .<br>
HTML is super easy for absolute beginners<br> like me for example, its easy to learn,non-complex, easy to read and efficient.<br> Think of a house, <strong><em>HTML</em></strong> is the structure and <strong><em>CSS</em></strong> is the paint and <strong><em>JavaScript</em></strong> adds interactivity, which I want to learn!</p>

<u><h2>How to do HTML?</h2></u>

<p>HTML is super easy to learn!<br>
Just learn the tags and their attributes!<br>
For example, to make a paragraph, use the tag p, if you want to break a line, use the tag!<br>
To make a heading use the tag h1,h2,h3 etc.<br>
To make a link use the tag a with the attribute href.<br>
To make a button use the tag button.<br>
To make an image use the tag img with the attribute src.<br>
To make text bold use the tag strong.<br>
To make text italic use the tag em.<br>
To make a horizontal line use the tag hr.<br>
To make a footer use the tag footer.<br>
Happy coding!</p>

<p>I hope more people will learn HTML!</p>
